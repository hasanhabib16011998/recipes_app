Dissolve 2 1/4 teaspoons of active dry yeast in 1 1/2 cups of warm water and let it sit for about 5 minutes until it becomes frothy. In a large mixing bowl, combine 3 1/2 to 4 cups of all-purpose flour, 2 tablespoons of olive oil, 2 teaspoons of salt, and 1 teaspoon of sugar. Gradually add the yeast mixture to the flour mixture, stirring until a dough forms. Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 5-7 minutes until it is smooth and elastic. Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover it with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1-2 hours, or until it has doubled in size.\r\n\r\nWhile the dough is rising, prepare the pizza sauce. In a saucepan, heat 1-2 tablespoons of olive oil over medium heat and sauté 2 minced garlic cloves until fragrant. Add a can of tomato sauce, a can of tomato paste, 1 teaspoon each of dried oregano, dried basil, and 1/2 teaspoon of dried thyme. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Let the sauce simmer for about 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally.\r\n\r\nOnce the dough has risen, preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C). Punch down the dough and divide it into two equal portions. Roll out each portion on a floured surface into a 12-inch circle and transfer it to a pizza stone or baking sheet. Spread a generous amount of pizza sauce over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges. Sprinkle 2 cups of shredded mozzarella cheese and 1/2 cup of grated Parmesan cheese evenly over the sauce. Add your favorite toppings, such as pepperoni, bell peppers, mushrooms, and black olives.\r\n\r\nBake the pizzas in the preheated oven for about 12-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly and melted. Remove the pizzas from the oven and let them cool for a few minutes before slicing. Garnish with fresh basil leaves if desired. Serve immediately and enjoy your homemade pizza!"}}, {"model": "core.recipe", "pk": 3, "fields": {"name": "Tea", "ingredients": "Tea, Water, Kettle, Milk, Suger", "picture": "tea.jpeg", "difficulty": "Easy", "prep_time": 5, "prep_guide": "To make a perfect cup of tea, begin by boiling fresh water in a kettle. Once the water reaches a rolling boil, pour it over a tea bag or loose tea leaves placed in a teapot or cup. Allow the tea to steep for 3-5 minutes, depending on the desired strength and type of tea. For black tea, a longer steeping time is ideal, while green tea benefits from a shorter infusion to avoid bitterness. After steeping, remove the tea bag or strain the leaves. Add sweeteners, milk, lemon, or other flavorings to taste. Finally, stir gently and enjoy your freshly brewed tea."}}, {"model": "core.recipe", "pk": 4, "fields": {"name": "yogurt", "ingredients": "4 cup milk, 2 tablespoon yougurt", "picture": "yogurt.jpg", "difficulty": "Medium", "prep_time": 180, "prep_guide": "To make homemade yogurt, start by heating 4 cups of whole milk in a saucepan over medium heat until it reaches 180°F (82°C), stirring occasionally to prevent scorching. Once the milk is heated, let it cool to 110°F (43°C). In a small bowl, mix 2 tablespoons of plain yogurt with live active cultures with a few tablespoons of the cooled milk to create a smooth mixture, then stir this mixture back into the rest of the cooled milk. Pour the milk mixture into a clean container and cover it. Place the container in a warm environment, such as an oven with the light on or a warm spot in your kitchen, and let it incubate for 6-12 hours, depending on how thick and tangy you want the yogurt. After incubation, transfer the container to the refrigerator and chill the yogurt for at least 2 hours before serving. Enjoy your homemade yogurt plain or with toppings like fruit, honey, nuts, or granola, and save a couple of tablespoons to use as a starter for your next batch."}}]
